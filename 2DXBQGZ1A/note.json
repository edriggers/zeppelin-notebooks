To understand the topics in this section, you need to have experience with SQL, and some programming experience with Python or Scala. You should also have experience with implementing Machine Learning, data transformation, data analysis, streaming, model design and selection, and results interpretation. You can expect to spend 2-3 hours completing this curriculum.\n\nNote that each notebook contains a link to the next notebook in the sequence, and most notebooks also contain links to related pages in our Splice Machine Documentation web.\n\nThis is the sequence of notebooks in our *Splice Machine Data Scientist* class:\n\n<table class=\"splicezepOddEven\">\n    <col />\n    <col />\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;1.</td>\n            <td>If you've not already done so, please visit our <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DX2STBE7\"><em>General Introduction to Splice Machine</em></a> notebook for an overview of Splice Machine before diving into this set of notebooks.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;2.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DUNNSQYR\"><em>Notebook Basics</em></a> notebook is a brief introduction to running and creating/modifying Zeppelin notebooks, which you'll need to know before proceeding with the other notebooks in this section.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;3.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DWWYV8BB\"><em>Running Queries</em></a> notebook introduces you to querying your Splice Machine database.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;4.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DWE2XT8V\"><em>Zeppelin Basic Features</em></a> notebook demonstrates writing and running a Spark program in Zeppelin.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;5.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DXQ24QYP\"><em>Zeppelin Example Using R (SparkR)</em></a> notebook demonstrates writing and running an R program in Zeppelin.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;6.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DVA8BB42\"><em>Visualizing Results with Zeppelin</em></a> notebook shows you how to use Zeppelin for filtering and graphing query results.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;7.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DYC2S8DY\"><em>Machine Learning with Spark MLib using Python</em></a> notebook contains Python code that uses the Machine Learning Library embedded in Spark, <em>MLlib</em>, with the Splice Machine Spark Adapter to realize in-process machine learning.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;8.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DY411M2A\"><em>Supply Chain Reference App</em></a> notebook is a machine learning app that predicts supply chain timeliness and shortages.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;9.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DX6TGACY\"><em>KMeans</em></a> notebook presents an unsupervised-learning, clustering algorithm used to determine similarities and trends within a given dataset.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;10.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DUQ8F96K\"><em>Decision Trees</em></a> notebook demonstrates how to load a LIBSVM data file, parse it as an RDD of LabeledPoint and then perform classification using a decision tree with Gini impurity as an impurity measure.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;11.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DWVX87QY\"><em>Data Engineering - ETL Pipeline</em></a> notebook presents a simple example of implementing an ETL pipeline with Splice Machine.<td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n",
