We will:\n\n* Create database for IoT in Splice Machine\n* Start a Kafka stream that is a proxy for the data streams generated by Edge Bridges and other processing \n* Create a spark streaming process to retrieve data from the kafka queue\n* Ingest that data into Splice Machine using the splice adapter\n* Run real-time queries and reports while simultaneously continuing to ingest data into splice database\n  \nThis demo uses our cloud infrastructure, which is based on Mesosphere DC/OS. Currently this is implemented on AWS, but it is portable to Azure, Google Cloud and can even be used for on-premise deployments. Splice plans to offer the service on these additional platforms later in 2018\n",
