Splice Machine imports data directly from S3; if your flat files are already stored in S3, you can skip this tutorial and jump to the next, which walks you through importing your data from S3 into your Splice Machine database.\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:50px\"><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:bold;\">Important:</span> the flat files you use to import should be delimited (using comma, etc.), with newlines between each record.</p>\n\n\nTo copy your database to S3, you need to have an AWS account with access to S3 buckets.\n\n<p class=\"noteNote\">If you need assistance with copying your data to S3, please <a href=\"mailto:support@splicemachine.com\">contact Splice Machine</a>.</p>\n\n## Copying Small Files From Your Local Machine\nFor small files on your local machine, you may be able to use the AWS Web UI to upload your files:\n\n1. Log in to your AWS account\n2. Navigate to the S3 area\n3. Create an S3 bucket, if necessary\n4. Navigate to your S3 bucket\n5. Click the `Upload` button\n6. Select the files to copy  or use drag-and-drop to copy them to S3\n\n## Copying Large Files\nThe files that you want to import into your database are typically large and not located on your local computer; this makes it necessary to use the *AWS Command Line Interface* to copy these files to S3.\n\nThe AWS CLI site, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\" target=\"_blank\">https://aws.amazon.com/cli/</a>, shows you how to install and use this interface to copy your data up to an S3 bucket.
