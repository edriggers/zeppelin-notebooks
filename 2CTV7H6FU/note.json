and guide you to your next steps.</p>\n<p class=\"noteIcon\">We recommend going through the Notebooks in our <em>Getting Started Tutorial</em> in sequence, starting with <a href=\"/#/notebook/2CTKW7A6U\">Notebook Basics</a>; these Notebooks build on results generated by previous steps to guide you through importing data, making queries, and tuning those queries for better performance.</p>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve completed the Tutorials, you can explore our other Notebooks, which illustrate the database capabilities, and walk you through reference applications using Splice Machine along with other tools, including streaming, supply chain management, and machine learning.</p>\n</div>"
