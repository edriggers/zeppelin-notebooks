      "text": "%md\n## Technology Stack Overview\n\nSplice Machine is built on open-sourced, proven, distributed database technology, including HBase/Hadoop and Spark.\n\n### HBase/Hadoop\n\nThe persistent, durable storage of operational data in Splice Machine resides in the Apache HBase key-value store. HBase:\n\n* is a non-relational (NoSQL) database that runs on top of HDFS\n* provides real-time read/write access to large datasets\n* scales linearly to handle huge data sets with billions of rows and millions of columns\n* is stored row-based and sorted by a primary key to deliver 1ms-10ms lookup speeds and short-range scans\n\n<img class=\"tiny\" src=\"https://hbase.apache.org/images/hbase_logo_with_orca.png\">\n\nHBase uses the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for reliable and replicated storage. HBase/HDFS provides auto-sharding and failover technology for scaling database tables across multiple servers. It is the only technology proven to scale to dozens of petabytes on commodity servers.\n\n### Spark In-Memory Computation Engine\n\nSplice Machine uses Spark for analytical processing.\n\nApache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports a general execution graph on sets of data.\n\n<img class=\"tiny\" src=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/img/spark-logo-hd.png\">\n\nSpark has very efficient in-memory processing that can spill to disk (instead of dropping the query) if the query processing exceeds available memory. Spark is also unique in its resilience to node failures, which may occur in a commodity cluster. Other in-memory technologies will drop all queries associated with a failed node, while Spark uses ancestry (as opposed to replicating data) to regenerate its in-memory Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) on another node.\n\nThe main abstraction Spark provides is a resilient distributed dataset (RDD), which is a collection of elements partitioned across the nodes of the cluster that can be operated on in parallel. RDDs are created by starting with a file in the Hadoop file system (or any other Hadoop-supported file system), or an existing Scala collection in the driver program, and transforming it. Users may also ask Spark to persist an RDD in memory, allowing it to be reused efficiently across parallel operations. Finally, RDDs automatically recover from node failures.\n\nSpark is optimized to work on DataFrames, which are the main structure used by Spark. A DataFrame is a distributed collection of data (an RDD) organized into named columns, with a schema that specifies data types, that is designed to support efficiently operating on scalable, massive datasets.\n\n#### Spark RDD Operations\n\nRDDs support two types of operations: transformations, which create a new dataset from an existing one, and actions, which return a value to the driver program after running a computation on the dataset. For example, map is a transformation that passes each dataset element through a function and returns a new RDD representing the results. On the other hand, reduce is an action that aggregates all the elements of the RDD using some function and returns the final result to the driver program (although there is also a parallel reduceByKey that returns a distributed dataset).\n\nAll transformations in Spark are lazy, in that they do not compute their results right away. Instead, they just remember the transformations applied to some base dataset (e.g. a file). The transformations are only computed when an action requires a result to be returned to the driver program. This design enables Spark to run more efficiently. For example, we can realize that a dataset created through map will be used in a reduce and return only the result of the reduce to the driver, rather than the larger mapped dataset.\n\n#### Spark Acceleration\n\nSplice Machine accelerates generation of Spark RDDs by reading HBase HFiles in HDFS and augmenting it with any changes in Memstore that have not been flushed to HFiles. Splice Machine then uses the RDDs and Spark operators to distribute processing across Spark Workers.\n\n### Resource Isolation\n\nSplice Machine isolates the resources allocated to HBase and Spark from each other, so each can progress independent of the workload of the other. Combined with the MVCC locking mechanism, this ensures that the performance level of transactional workloads can remain high, even if large reports or analytic processes are running.\n\n",

HBase:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>is a non-relational (NoSQL) database that runs on top of HDFS</li>\n  <li>provides real-time read/write access to large datasets</li>\n  <li>scales linearly to handle huge data sets with billions of rows and millions of columns</li>\n  <li>is stored row-based and sorted by a primary key to deliver 1ms-10ms lookup speeds and short-range scans</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"tiny\" src=\"https://hbase.apache.org/images/hbase_logo_with_orca.png\">\n<p>HBase uses the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for reliable and replicated storage. HBase/HDFS provides auto-sharding and failover technology for scaling database tables across multiple servers. It is the only technology proven to scale to dozens of petabytes on commodity servers.</p>\n<h3>Spark In-Memory Computation Engine</h3>\n<p>Splice Machine uses Spark for analytical processing.</p>\n<p>Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports a general execution graph on sets of data.</p>\n<img class=\"tiny\" src=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/img/spark-logo-hd.png\">\n<p>Spark has very efficient in-memory processing that can spill to disk (instead of dropping the query) if the query processing exceeds available memory. Spark is also unique in its resilience to node failures, which may occur in a commodity cluster. Other in-memory technologies will drop all queries associated with a failed node, while Spark uses ancestry (as opposed to replicating data) to regenerate its in-memory Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) on another node.</p>\n<p>The main abstraction Spark provides is a resilient distributed dataset (RDD), which is a collection of elements partitioned across the nodes of the cluster that can be operated on in parallel. RDDs are created by starting with a file in the Hadoop file system (or any other Hadoop-supported file system), or an existing Scala collection in the driver program, and transforming it. Users may also ask Spark to persist an RDD in memory, allowing it to be reused efficiently across parallel operations. Finally, RDDs automatically recover from node failures.</p>\n<p>Spark is optimized to work on DataFrames, which are the main structure used by Spark. A DataFrame is a distributed collection of data (an RDD) organized into named columns, with a schema that specifies data types, that is designed to support efficiently operating on scalable, massive datasets.</p>\n<h4>Spark RDD Operations</h4>\n<p>RDDs support two types of operations: transformations, which create a new dataset from an existing one, and actions, which return a value to the driver program after running a computation on the dataset. For example, map is a transformation that passes each dataset element through a function and returns a new RDD representing the results. On the other hand, reduce is an action that aggregates all the elements of the RDD using some function and returns the final result to the driver program (although there is also a parallel reduceByKey that returns a distributed dataset).</p>\n<p>All transformations in Spark are lazy, in that they do not compute their results right away. Instead, they just remember the transformations applied to some base dataset (e.g. a file). The transformations are only computed when an action requires a result to be returned to the driver program. This design enables Spark to run more efficiently. For example, we can realize that a dataset created through map will be used in a reduce and return only the result of the reduce to the driver, rather than the larger mapped dataset.</p>\n<h4>Spark Acceleration</h4>\n<p>Splice Machine accelerates generation of Spark RDDs by reading HBase HFiles in HDFS and augmenting it with any changes in Memstore that have not been flushed to HFiles. Splice Machine then uses the RDDs and Spark operators to distribute processing across Spark Workers.</p>\n<h3>Resource Isolation</h3>\n<p>Splice Machine isolates the resources allocated to HBase and Spark from each other, so each can progress independent of the workload of the other. Combined with the MVCC locking mechanism, this ensures that the performance level of transactional workloads can remain high, even if large reports or analytic processes are running.</p>\n</div>"
