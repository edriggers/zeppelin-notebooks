K can be computed a number of ways, none of which are necessarily incorrect. It is dependent on the specific dataset you are working with. It is suggested to first plot your data and do trials with multiple values of K.

K clusters are created and assigned locations, either randomly generated or randomly taken from K datapoints\n2. For each datapoint in your dataset, the square Euclidian Distance is computed against all clusters until a minimum is found. That datapoint is assigned to the cluster of minimum distance\n3. After all datapoints are assigned, clusters are recomputed and reassigned locations using the mean distance of its assigned datapoints.\n\n#### Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until one of the following:\n* A set number of iterations occurs\n* No datapoints are reassigned to new clusters\n* Minimum distance changes occur within clusters\n\nLearn more about KMeans algorithm [here](https://www.datascience.com/blog/introduction-to-k-means-clustering-algorithm-learn-data-science-tutorials)\nIn-depth KMeans clustering documentation [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means)\n\n#### We will now create a simple KMeans example.\nTo follow along with this data, download [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datascienceinc/learn-data-science/master/Introduction-to-K-means-Clustering/Data/data_1024.csv)\nMore KMeans and Scala examples [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib)\n\nLearn about Sum of Squares for Errors (used later in algorithm) [here](http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-the-Sum-of-Squares-for-Error-(SSE))","user":"anonymous","dateUpdated":"2017-06-20T11:45:08-0500","config":{"colWidth":12,"enabled":true,"results":{"0":{"graph":{"mode":"table","height":70.375,"optionOpen":false}}},"editorSetting":{"language":"markdown","editOnDblClick":true},"editorMode":"ace/mode/markdown","editorHide":true,"tableHide":false},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"results":{"code":"SUCCESS","msg":[{"type":"HTML","data":"<div class=\"markdown-body\">\n<h1>KMeans</h1>\n<p>KMeans is an unsupervised-learning, clustering algorithm used to determine similarities and trends within a given dataset<br/>KMeans is an iterative process, where K clusters are created by the user and continualy computed on a given dataset until the data converges and the algorithm ends.</p>\n<h2>Setting up a KMeans</h2>\n<p>To implement KMeans, you will need two things:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A dataset of structured data.
