<h1>The Splice Machine Training Notebook Scrubber</h1>
The <em>Training Notebook Scrubber</em> is a Python program, written by Chris Maahs, that is automatically run as part of the build process whenever a new Docker image is generated for our Zeppelin-based training classes.

Our training notebooks contain two kinds of paragraphs:

<ul>
    <li><em>Markdown</em> paragraphs contain descriptive information that help guide the student through each notebook.</li>
    <li><em>Code</em> paragraphs contain code that the student can run.</li>
</ul>

The scrubber iterates through the JSON representation of each paragraph in every notebook, and performs different actions on each type of paragraph; you can also manually perform or reverse most of these actions while running a notebook in Zeppelin by selecting an action from the paragraph's menu.

<h2>Why It's Important</h2>
Modifying a Zeppelin notebook can easily leave the paragraphs in a state that is not appropriate for someone using a fresh instance of the notebook in a training session. For example:

<ul>
    <li>It's not appropriate for a student to run a static Markdown paragraph; when you edit a Markdown paragraph, you need to run it for its display to be updated. Without the scrubber, you would need to re-disable.</li>
    <li>A paragraph that the student needs to run should have its status displayed as <code>READY</code> and one that is not to be run should not display its status as <code>FINISHED</code>.</li>
    <li>The output of a paragraph that the student needs to run should not display until it is run by the student.</li>
    <li>Completely empty paragraphs should be removed to avoid confusion.</li>
    <li>The status (or error) information the Zeppelin displays after a paragraph is run should be removed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scrubbing Markdown Paragraphs</h2>
The scrubber resets the state of every Markdown paragraph in every training notebook as shown in the following table:

<table>
    <col width=60% />
    <col width=40% />
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>What the Scrubber Does</th>
            <th>Paragraph Menu Equivalent</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>Disables running of the paragraph, so that the user is not presented with that possibility (the <img src="https://doc.splicemachine.com/zeppelin/images/zepPlayIcon.png" class="inline"> is not displayed.)</p>
                <p>Note that the Scrubber maintains a list of override exceptions for any markdown paragraphs that do need to be run by the student;  for example, the <em>Zeppelin Basics<em> notebook includes a paragraph in which the student practices adding and running markdown. In these cases, the Scrubber enables running of the paragraph.</p>
            </td>
            <td>
                <p>Click the the <img src="https://doc.splicemachine.com/zeppelin/images/zepSettingsIcon.png" class="inline"> icon for the paragraph, and select <code>Disable Run</code>.</p>
                <p>To reenable, click the icon again and select <code>Enable Run</code>.</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Set the status of the paragraph to <code>FINISHED</code>.</td>
            <td>N/A.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>Hides the paragraph editor.<p>
                <p>Note that the Scrubber maintains a list of override exceptions for paragraphs that do need to have the editor open; for example, the <em>Zeppelin Basics</em> notebook includes a paragraph in which the student practices adding and running markdown. In these cases, the Scrubber does not hide the paragraph editor.</p>
            </td>
            <td>
                <p>Click the the <img src="https://doc.splicemachine.com/zeppelin/images/zepEditorIcon.png" class="inline"> icon for the paragraph.</p>
                <p>To re-display the editor, click the icon again.</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hides the status information that Zeppelin displays at the bottom of the paragraph's output after running a paragraph. </td>
            <td>N/A</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Deletes empty markdown paragraphs.</td>
            <td><p>Click the the <img src="https://doc.splicemachine.com/zeppelin/images/zepSettingsIcon.png" class="inline"> icon for the paragraph, and select <code>Remove</code>.</p>
                <p>Note that the Scrubber maintains a list of override exceptions for paragraphs that are empty and need to remain in the notebook; in these cases, the Scrubber does not delete the paragraph.</p>
                <p><strong>NOTE: </strong> You cannot undo removal of a paragraph from a notebook!</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    <tbody>
</table>


<h2>Scrubbing Code Paragraphs</h2>
The scrubber resets the state of every code (non-Markdown) paragraph in every training notebook as shown in the following table:

<table>
    <col width=60% />
    <col width=40% />
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>What the Scrubber Does</th>
            <th>Paragraph Menu Equivalent</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>Enables running of the paragraph, so that the user is sees the (the <img src="https://doc.splicemachine.com/zeppelin/images/zepPlayIcon.png" class="inline"> icon.</p>
                <p>Note that the Scrubber maintains a list of override exceptions for any markdown paragraphs that should not be run by the student;  in these cases, the Scrubber disables running of the paragraph.</p>
            </td>
            <td>
                <p>Click the the <img src="https://doc.splicemachine.com/zeppelin/images/zepSettingsIcon.png" class="inline"> icon for the paragraph, and select <code>Enable Run</code>.</p>
                <p>To reset to disabled, click the icon again and select <code>Disable Run</code>.</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Set the status of the paragraph to <code>READY</code>.</td>
            <td>N/A.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hides the status information that Zeppelin displays at the bottom of the paragraph's output after running a paragraph, including the date it was started/finished, and how long it took. </td>
            <td>N/A</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Clears the output of the paragraph, so that the user must run it to generate results.</td>
            <td>Click the the <img src="https://doc.splicemachine.com/zeppelin/images/zepSettingsIcon.png" class="inline"> icon for the paragraph, and select <code>Clear Output</code>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Deletes empty paragraphs, which are those without an assigned interpreter, e.g. <code>%splicemachine</code>, <code>%spark</code>, etc.</td>
            <td><p>Click the the <img src="https://doc.splicemachine.com/zeppelin/images/zepSettingsIcon.png" class="inline"> icon for the paragraph, and select <code>Remove</code>.</p>
                <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>You cannot undo removal of a paragraph from a notebook!</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    <tbody>

<h2>Adding Exceptions</h2>
Currently, the exception types processed by the Scrubber are:

<ul>
    <li><code>MarkdownEditorOpen</code> exceptions indicate that the editor is to be displayed for specified Markdown paragraph.</li>
</ul>

Exceptions are stored in the <code>notebook_standards_exceptions.yaml</code> file. The following sample YAML content includes three exceptions: the <code>MarkdownEditorOverride</code> exception is to be applied to each paragraph indicated by the (notebook ID, paragraph ID) pair e.g. (<code>2DY5CJ4CS, 20170915-085028_60994898</code>).

<pre>
    Exceptions:
      2DY5CJ4CS:
        20170915-085028_60994898:
          MarkdownEditorOpen: true
      2DUNNSQYR:
        20170915-085028_60994898:
