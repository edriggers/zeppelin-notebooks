To understand the topics in this section, you need to have experience with SQL.  For some notebooks some familiarity with Python or Scala is recommended. You can expect to spend 2-3 hours completing this curriculum.\n\nNote that each notebook contains a link to the next notebook in the sequence, and most notebooks also contain links to related pages in our Splice Machine Documentation web.\n\nThis is the sequence of notebooks in our *Splice Machine Advanced Developer's* class:\n\n<table class=\"splicezepOddEven\">\n    <col />\n    <col />\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;1.</td>\n            <td>If you've not already done so, please complete our <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DYAK9C9S\"><em>Developer's Guide - Part 1</em></a> training class.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;2.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DW2MCTTP\"><em>Running the TPCH-1 Benchmark Queries</em></a> notebook introduces you to importing TPCH-1 benchmark data into your database and then creating indexes, compacting your database, collecting statistics, and running the TPCH-1 queries.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;3.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DUK929SD\"><em>Common Utilities</em></a> notebook describes a number of utilities that you may find useful when working with Splice Machine.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;4.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DWS5FM39\"><em>The Life of a Query</em></a> notebook is a more in-depth walk-through of creating, populating, and querying TPCH benchmark data in Splice Machine.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;5.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DY6YKEVA\"><em>Visualizing Results with Zeppelin</em></a> notebook shows you how to use Zeppelin for filtering and graphing query results.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;6.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DUKWWK84\"><em>Transactions with Spark and JDBC</em></a> notebook provides a glimpse into the transactional nature of Splice Machine and introduces use of the <code>%spark</code> interpreter with a JDBC connection.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;7.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DVU2ESP3\"><em>Creating Applications with Splice Machine</em></a> notebook shows you how to run a <em>Spring</em> application (the <em>Petclinic</em> web app) with Splice Machine.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;8.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DW6E5Z1X\"><em>Using the Splice Machine Native Spark DataSource</em></a> notebook demonstrates how our Native Spark DataSource allows you to adopt the full power of Spark and manipulate dataframes while also having the power of full ANSI, ACID-compliant SQL.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>&nbsp;9.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DWTYCFTY\"><em>Machine Learning with Spark MLib using Python</em></a> notebook contains Python code that uses the Machine Learning Library embedded in Spark, <em>MLlib</em>, with the Splice Machine Spark Adapter to realize in-process machine learning.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>10.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DWAGKSPM\"><em>Creating Custom Stored Procedures</em></a> notebook show you how to create and deploy custom, stored functions and procedures that you can call from your SQL queries in Splice Machine .</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>11.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"/#/notebook/2DXK4FQKX\"><em>ETL Pipeline</em></a> notebook presents a simple example of constructing an ETL pipeline with Splice Machine.</td>\n        </tr>\n   </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n        ",
