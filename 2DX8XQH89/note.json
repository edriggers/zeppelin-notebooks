Splice Machine imports data directly from HDFS, AWS S3, and Azure Block Storage.  \n\nFor this training we'll use S3, and the data we will import is already created and ready to load.  If you want to learn more about how to import your own data, read on - otherwise continue to the [*Importing Data*](/#/notebook/2DVR1D5BP) notebook.\n\n## Preparing Your Own Data for Import\nWhen you want to experiment with loading your own data from S3, you can follow the steps below to get your data into an S3 bucket.  Additionally you will want to make sure your data is in a format that can be properly imported. Splice Machine has extensive online documentation on importing options and best practices.\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:50px\"><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:bold;\">Important:</span> the flat files you use to import should be delimited (using comma, etc.), with newlines between each record.</p>\n\n\nTo copy your database to S3, you need to have an AWS account with access to S3 buckets.\n\n<p class=\"noteNote\">If you need assistance with copying your data to S3, please visit our <a href=\"https://splicemachine.slack.com/messages/splice-community/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>splice-community Slack channel</em></a>; if you've not already done so, you can register for this channel <a href=\"https://www.splicemachine.com/community/slack-channel-signup/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n## Copying Small Files From Your Local Machine\nFor small files on your local machine, you may be able to use the AWS Web UI to upload your files:\n\n1. Log in to your AWS account\n2. Navigate to the S3 area\n3. Create an S3 bucket, if necessary\n4. Navigate to your S3 bucket\n5. Click the `Upload` button\n6. Select the files to copy  or use drag-and-drop to copy them to S3\"\n\n## Copying Large Files\nThe files that you want to import into your database are typically large and not located on your local computer; this makes it necessary to use the *AWS Command Line Interface* to copy these files to S3.\n\nThe AWS CLI site, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\" target=\"_blank\">https://aws.amazon.com/cli/</a>, shows you how to install and use this interface to copy your data up to an S3 bucket.
